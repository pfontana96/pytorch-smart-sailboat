Implementation of Q-Reinforcement-Learning to control an autonomous sailboat using PyTorch

## WORK IN PROGRESS!!

## Introduction

This is a part of an academic project to implement different AI-algorithms to an autonomous sailboat (Only a simmulator right now).
I saw this problem as a perfect opportunity to implement Reinforcement Learning. All my work here supposes that the simmulator does work correctly (it was not part of the project and it was given by a third).



## Requisites

This was tested using Python 3.6.x. and PyTorch 1.0.1

## Conclusions

## Improvements

I hope this repository may be useful to someone, if you come up with any suggestion or improvement I will be grateful to hear it!
