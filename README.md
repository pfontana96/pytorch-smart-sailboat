Implementation of Q-Reinforcement-Learning to control an autonomous sailboat using PyTorch

This is a part of an academic project to implement different AI-algorithms to an autonomous sailboat (Only a simmulator right now).
I decided to use Reinforcement Learning in PyTorch.

## Requisites

This was tested using Python 3.6.x. and PyTorch 1.0.1
