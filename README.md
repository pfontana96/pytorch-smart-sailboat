Implementation of Q-Reinforcement-Learning to control an autonomous sailboat using PyTorch

## WORK IN PROGRESS!!

## Introduction

This is a part of an academic project to implement different AI-algorithms to an autonomous sailboat (Only a simmulator right now). All the work here supposes that the simmulator does work correctly (it was not part of the project and it was given by a third).



## Requisites

This was tested using Python 3.6.x. and PyTorch 1.0.1
